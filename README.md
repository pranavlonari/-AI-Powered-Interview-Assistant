**Author:** Pranav Lonari  

---

## Overview  
This project is a **React-based AI Interview Assistant** that helps conduct mock technical interviews in a structured and automated way. It provides two synchronized views:  

- **Interviewee (Chat)** ‚Äì where candidates upload resumes, answer AI-generated interview questions, and track their progress with timers.  
- **Interviewer (Dashboard)** ‚Äì where interviewers can monitor candidates, view scores, chat history, and summaries.  

The application supports **local persistence**, so all progress is saved even after a page refresh or browser restart.

## Features  

### üîπ Interviewee (Chat)  
- **Resume Upload (PDF/DOCX):**  
  - Extracts **Name, Email, and Phone** from the uploaded resume.  
  - If any details are missing, the chatbot asks the candidate before starting.  
- **Interview Flow:**  
  - 6 questions total ‚Üí **2 Easy (20s each)**, **2 Medium (60s each)**, **2 Hard (120s each)**.  
  - AI dynamically generates one question at a time.  
  - Automatic submission when time runs out.  
  - At the end, AI calculates a **final score** and generates a **short summary**.  
- **Session Persistence:**  
  - If the candidate refreshes or closes the page, progress is restored on reopening.  
  - A **‚ÄúWelcome Back‚Äù modal** helps resume the session.  
- **Tab-Switch Detection:**  
  - If the candidate switches browser tabs during the interview, the test is **instantly auto-submitted** to prevent cheating.
